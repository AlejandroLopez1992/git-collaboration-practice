## Git Collaboration Practice BE/ FE

- **Set Up Instructions**
- **Deploy Link** (if applicable)
- **Abstract/Elevator Pitch** (what problem is app trying to solve?)
- **Contributors** (including who owned what pieces?)
- **Links to Wireframe/Planning docs** (if applicable)
- **Tech Stack** (including testing + accessibility)
- **Context** (time allotted, # of people, mod, learning goals)
- **Wins/Challenges** (personal or team)
- **Future Additions** (these should be entered as Issues and on your Project Board as well)
- **ONE gif** (show the highest impact feature of your app)
- You can add comments in your README for things you want to document but don’t want shown (just remember these are still viewable to everyone in the raw file)

Obviously including all of this would be a bit much. Think about - What do you want someone to know about this project AND what do you want to remember about this project?
